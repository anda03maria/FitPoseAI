## Exercise Execution Evaluation Based on Body Posture Using Neural Networks

 This repository contains the source code and documentation for my bachelor's thesis, developed as part of my studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Babe»ô-Bolyai University (UBB), 2025. 


 The subject of this thesis is the development of a web-based application that integrates artificial intelligence for the purpose of evaluating the execution of physical exercises. The project addresses a growing need for intelligent, user-friendly tools that assist individuals in performing exercises correctly, especially in contexts where access to professional supervision is limited.
 The thesis is structured in three main chapters. The first chapter presents the theoretical foundations of posture evaluation and biomechanical correctness, along with an overview of the deep learning models commonly used in this domain. The second chapter introduces the proposed methodology, detailing the architecture of three AI models: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for static images, a CNN-LSTM hybrid for video sequences, and a gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost) based on biomechanical features extracted with MediaPipe. The third chapter is focused on the software implementation, describing both the frontend (ReactJS) and backend (FastAPI) components and their integration with the AI models.
 The main contributions of this thesis consist in designing and implementing an application capable of evaluating exercise execution based on AI models. The originality of the project lies in its ability to support different input formats (images and videos), offer both visual and numerical feedback, and integrate multiple analysis methods within a single scalable system. Moreover, the application was tested using real data and demonstrates high accuracy in classifying exercise performance quality.
 This work is the result of my own activity. I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.
